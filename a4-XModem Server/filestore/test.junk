A file transfer protocol is an agreement between sender and receiver for transferring a file across a (possibly unreliable) connection. You use HTTP to receive files every day when visiting webpages, and you may be familiar with FTP which is another popular protocol for file transfers.

In this assignment, you'll be writing a server for a file transfer protocol called xmodem. When finished, you will be able to connect an xmodem client to your server and send a file to your server using the xmodem protocol.
